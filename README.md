## Introduction
The **Meteorite Landings** dataset includes information about over 45,000 meteorites, such as:
- Location of landing
- Mass
- Composition
- Year of fall

This dataset provides a unique opportunity for researchers, scientists, and data enthusiasts to explore the mysteries of extraterrestrial phenomena.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and patterns in meteorite landings.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Map meteorite locations using latitude and longitude data.
- **Statistical Insights**: Analyze the distribution of meteorite masses, compositions, and fall years.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use the Metropolis algorithm to simulate future meteorite landing patterns.

## Data Source

## Metropolis Algorithm
The project incorporates the **Metropolis algorithm**, a method from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, to model and simulate meteorite patterns. Below are its key aspects:

1. **Purpose**:
   - Sample from probability distributions that describe meteorite characteristics like mass and location.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Iteratively generates samples, with each sample based on the previous one.
   - Parameters such as mean (e.g., 100) and standard deviation (e.g., 20) control the sampling behavior.

3. **Applications**:
   - Predictive modeling for future meteorite landings.
   - Simulating and validating patterns observed in historical data.

4. **Insights**:
   - The algorithm effectively captures meteorite distribution patterns.
   - Results align closely with observed data, making it a reliable tool for modeling.

## Findings
1. **Meteorite Mass Trends**:
   - A wide range of meteorite masses, with clustering of smaller meteorites and rare large ones.

2. **Geospatial Distribution**:
   - Certain regions show higher meteorite landing densities, linked to geographical and observational factors.

3. **Temporal Patterns**:
   - Increasing trend in meteorite detections post-1800s, likely due to improved scientific methods.

4. **Predictive Insights**:
   - The Metropolis algorithmâ€™s simulations provide realistic predictions for future meteorite landings.
